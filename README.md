CitiBike NYC / Bike Share Data Best Practices
=====================

On 24 July 2013, Council Member Brad Lander introduced Int. No 1117-2013. This is a local law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the complication of Citi Bike usage data. You can track this law on the New York City Council Legistar system at < http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1458686&GUID=A0A12057-4AE3-4CC8-BCD3-3277B0F7E1E0&Options=ID%7cText%7c&Search >.

This repository is designed to research Bike Share data best practices and combile it into a clear ask for more data. This work is being documented in this repo's wiki.

In the wiki < https://github.com/noneck/CitiBike-OpenData-Law/wiki >, you will find links to other bike share open data systems, outlines of the data they provide, and examples of other open data bike share laws.

In addtion to this repo, BetaNYC and NYU Rudin Center for Transportation host a monthly BikeHack night < http://meetup.com/betanyc > and there is a Google Group < https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/citibike-hackers >.
